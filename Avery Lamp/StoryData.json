  "DetailText":"My first line of code was written in Computer Science 1 during my freshman year at Millburn High School. I fell in love with coding. I started coding in my free time, learning what I know today. I continued with CS courses throughout high school and taught myself iOS development. In 10th grade, I published my first app as part of an English final. \n\n\n",

In the summer of 2014, I joined their tech department as a mobile developer. I was given a project to build an iPad app to view their website. By the end of the summer I finished the app. I didnâ€™t become an active developer until after my first hackathon. Hackathons and app development quickly became a defining part of who I am.\n\n\n",

  "DetailText":"My first hackathon was Penn Apps XI, a 1300+ person hackathon held by UPenn. I signed up without any knowledge of what a hackathon was and attended the event without a team. At the event, I met three other great iOS devs. We collaborated in creating an app called MagicPen. It uses CLLocationManager's raw compass data to detect a nearby magnet and derives its position, allowing the magnet to be used as a stylus. It was the coolest project I had built to date and it inspired me to improve as an iOS dev and to work on my own projects.\n\n\n",

 "DetailText":"My first line of code was written my freshman year at Millburn High School in Computer Science 1. I fell in love with coding and started coding in my free time, which is how I learned what I know today. I continued with CS courses throughout high school, while I taught myself iOS development in my spare time. At the end of 10th grade, I published my first app as part of an English final to spread awareness on a topic of my choice. I was pretty inactive as a developer until I went to my first Hackathon. Hackathons quickly became a defining part of who I am.\n\n\n",

 "DetailText":"One of the ways I got experience developing iOS apps, was through an internship. In the summer of 2014, I was a mobile dev intern in the tech department of U.S. Squash, the national governing non-profit company that organizes squash throughout the United States. The tech department was very small and I was a beginner at mobile development, so I was given a small project building an iPad app to view their website. By the end of the summer I finished the app and they kept it as a prototype.\n\n\n",

 "DetailText":"My first hackathon was Penn Apps XI, a 1300+ person hackathon held by UPenn. I signed up without any knowledge of what a hackathon was and I attended the event without a team. At the event, I met three other great iOS devs. We collaborated in creating an app called MagicPen. It uses CLLocationManager's raw compass data to detects a nearby magnet, derive its position, allowing the magnet to be used as a stylus. It was the coolest project I I had built and it inspired me to improve as an iOS dev and to work on my own projects.\n\n\n",

At the end of 24 hours, I was exhausted, but we had a fully functioning music visualizer to present to the judges. We won the Best Application Prize, which elated me because I could see my growth as a developer and my work paid off.\n\n\n",

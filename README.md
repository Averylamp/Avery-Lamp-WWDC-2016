# Avery Lamp's Portfolio App
==============================================

### _This app was made to demonstrate some of my development skills, projects,l and story behind me as an iOS Developer for the WWDC Scholarship_
##### Unfortunately, I was not awarded a scholarship, because my submission was faulty and was not submitted with the correct account

 ### How it was built:

I built my portfolio app in a little over two weeks of solid deveopment time using Swift 2.3
When I built my portfolio app, I concentrated on a few aspects of the app that I wanted to make spectacular.  One of my biggest concentrations was with 
UI/UX and animations.  Inside the app I put together many custom animations to transition the user from screen to screen.
